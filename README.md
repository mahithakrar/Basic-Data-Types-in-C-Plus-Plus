# Basic-Data-Types-in-C-Plus-Plus

Overview:
This program explores some of the most commonly used data types in C++. The main objective is to understand how different types of data are stored in memory, how much space each occupies, and how to use them effectively in a program.

C provides several built-in (primitive) data types, which define the type of data a variable can hold. The most commonly used are:
| Data Type | Description                  | Example Values      |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| `int`     | Integer numbers               | 10, -5, 100         |
| `float`   | Single-precision decimal      | 3.14, -0.5          |
| `double`  | Double-precision decimal      | 3.1415926, -12.3456 |
| `char`    | Single character              | 'A', 'z', '3'       |
Each data type has a specific size in memory (which can vary by system) and is used for different types of operations.

Requirements:
A C++ Compiler

Conclusion:
This simple program helps you understand how different data types work in C, how much memory they use, and how to use the sizeof operator. It's a fundamental step for writing efficient and error-free C programs.
