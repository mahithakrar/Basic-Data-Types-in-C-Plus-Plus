# Basic Data Types in C++

##  Overview
This program explores some of the most commonly used **data types** in C++.  
The main objective is to understand:
- How different types of data are stored in memory.
- How much space each occupies.
- How to use them effectively in a program.

C++ provides several **built-in (primitive) data types**, which define the type of data a variable can hold.

##  Common Data Types in C++

| Data Type | Description                  | Example Values      |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| `int`     | Integer numbers               | 10, -5, 100         |
| `float`   | Single-precision decimal      | 3.14, -0.5          |
| `double`  | Double-precision decimal      | 3.1415926, -12.3456 |
| `char`    | Single character              | 'A', 'z', '3'       |

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  
> Each data type has a specific size in memory, which may vary depending on the system architecture.

## Requirements
- A C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, or any IDE that supports C++)

##  Algorithm
1. **Start** the program.  
2. **Declare** variables of types: `int`, `float`, `string`, `double`, `char`, and `bool`.  
3. **Prompt** the user to enter an integer.  
4. **Store** the integer in `a` and display its value and size using `sizeof(a)`.  
5. **Prompt** the user to enter a float.  
6. **Store** it in `b` and display its value and size.  
7. **Prompt** the user to enter a string.  
8. **Store** it in `c` and display its value and size.  
9. **Prompt** the user to enter a double.  
10. **Store** it in `d` and display its value and size.  
11. **Prompt** the user to enter a character.  
12. **Store** it in `e` and display its value and size.  
13. **Prompt** the user to enter a boolean value (`1` for true, `0` for false).  
14. **Store** it in `f` and display its value and size.  
15. **End** the program.

âœ… Conclusion
Understanding basic data types in C++ is essential for writing efficient and type-safe programs.
They form the foundation for:
Memory management
Arithmetic operations
Data storage

By mastering these types, you can confidently move towards more advanced programming concepts.
